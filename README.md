## 🌱 About Me

Hello! I'm Jin Park, a first-year computer science student and self-taught developer with a strong background in international marketing, business communications, and over a decade in hospitality.

After years of being discouraged from pursuing tech due to traditional education limitations, I finally decided to build the tool I always wished existed — not just for myself, but for anyone who ever felt too overwhelmed, too lost, or too different to fit into rigid learning systems.

Now I’m building [**ALEXANDRIA**](https://startling-praline-fc0599.netlify.app/) — an intelligent, modular learning platform that redefines what education can be when we design with humanity, mental health, and inclusivity at the center.

## 🧠 Vision Project: ALEXANDRIA

ALEXANDRIA is a growing educational platform and experiment in radical accessibility. It's not just a Python learning app — it's an evolving **modular engine** for knowledge that:

- Makes learning interactive, visual, and human-first
- Offers mental health tools integrated into the learning experience
- Prioritizes accessibility with TTS, dyslexia fonts, dark mode, and more
- Reflects my own journey from struggling learner to builder

> “Alexandria is built on a single belief: People don’t fail to learn — we fail to build systems that respect how they learn.”

**Tech Stack**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Pyodide, Supabase, TipTap

**Features**:
- In-browser Python execution
- Learning journal with local and cloud persistence
- Accessibility panel (TTS, fonts, contrast)
- Dev mode editor for live content building
- Dynamic content engine with roadmap + changelogs
- Anonymous mental health tools in development
