## 🌱 About Me

Hello! I'm **Jin Park**, a first-year computer science student and self-taught developer with a background in international marketing and business communications.

After years of being discouraged from pursuing tech due to traditional educational limitations, I decided to build what I couldn’t find — a platform designed to adapt to how *humans actually learn*.

> ⚡ **ALEXANDRIA** is the system I always needed. Now I’m building it for others, too.

## 🧠 Vision Project: Alexandria

ALEXANDRIA is not just a Python tutorial — it's a **reimagined learning engine** designed for accessibility, emotional health, and modular scalability.

**Key Features:**
- 🧩 Modular curriculum engine (JSON/Markdown)
- 💬 In-browser code editor with Pyodide
- ♿ Accessibility-first (TTS, dyslexia font, contrast control)
- 🧠 Mental health tools (in progress)
- 🛠 Developer tools, roadmap, and changelog engine
- 🌐 Language expansion & Korean language learning planned

**Tech Stack:** React · TypeScript · Tailwind · Pyodide · Supabase · TipTap

> “People don’t fail to learn — we fail to build systems that respect how they learn.”
